# NCKU Microprocessor – PIC Assembly and Embedded C Labs

This repository contains lab assignments for the **Microprocessor** course at **National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)**, focusing on embedded systems programming using **PIC microcontrollers** in both Assembly and C.

## Course Topics

Through practical hands-on labs, this course explores the following microcontroller programming topics:

- Assembly-level programming using MPLAB X
- Addressing modes and register manipulation
- Bitwise operations and arithmetic computation
- C–Assembly integration
- Interrupts, timers, and real-time event handling
- PWM motor control and ADC conversion
- UART serial communication

## 🧪 Labs Overview

| Lab | Focus Area | Description |
|-----|------------|-------------|
| **Lab 1** | Instruction Set Basics | Arithmetic, bitwise logic, and flag handling |
| **Lab 2** | Addressing Modes | Direct/indirect access, summation, and binary search |
| **Lab 3** | Bitwise & Math | Logical shifts, 16-bit multiplication, base-2 logs |
| **Lab 4** | Macros & Subroutines | Custom math macros, Fibonacci, cross products |
| **Lab 5** | C–Assembly Integration | Math functions: ceil, sqrt, GCD with mixed code |
| **Lab 6** | LED & Button I/O | LED control, bouncing button handling |
| **Lab 7** | Interrupts & Timers | State-driven LED patterns with timer interrupts |
| **Lab 8** | Motor Control | PWM-based servo movement from -90° to +90° |
| **Lab 9** | ADC & PWM Brightness | Analog resistor input, binary display, ID digits |
| **Lab 10** | UART Communication | Serial I/O, LED control via keyboard commands |
